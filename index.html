        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I'm a Canadian who was born in Belgium to Ethiopian parents and raised in the Middle East. People tell me that my story is unique. I think my story is as unique as the next person.</p>
        <p>I’m currently a student, and have been one ever since I can remember. I suppose I will be one until I die. I have had many different favorite subjects in my life. My current favorite subject is web development. </p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>One day, I’d like to build my own web application that generates income on its own. That would free me up to learn more and give more. </p>
